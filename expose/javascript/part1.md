1. In line 9, "values added: 20" is printed.
2. In line 13, "final result: 20" is printed.
3. You shouldn't use var because it can appear outside the block scope. 
4. If run by itself, it compiles same code as number 1. However, because there is an error in line 13, it does not compile.
5. There is an error where result is not defined because it is only defined in the if statement.
6. Nothing because there is an error because we are trying to change a const variable that remains the same value
7. Nothing printed because of the error before and can only occur after the if else statement.
